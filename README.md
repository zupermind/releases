<details>
<summary><b>ü™ü Windows (Experimental)</b></summary>

**‚ö†Ô∏è Note:** Windows support is currently experimental. Please report any issues you encounter.

#### Option 1: Windows Installer (Recommended)

Download and run the installer for your architecture:
- **x64**: `mcdp-[VERSION]-windows-amd64-installer.exe`
- **ARM64**: `mcdp-[VERSION]-windows-arm64-installer.exe`

The installer will:
- Install the MCDP CLI to `C:\Program Files\MCDP`
- Optionally add it to your system PATH (recommended)
- Allow uninstallation through Windows Settings

**Important:** After installation, you'll need to open a new PowerShell or Command Prompt window for the PATH changes to take effect.

#### Option 2: Manual Installation (PowerShell/Command Prompt)

1. Download the standalone `.exe` file for your architecture
2. **If downloaded via browser:** You may see security warnings - click "More info" ‚Üí "Run anyway"

#### Manual Installation via PowerShell:

```powershell
# For x64
curl -L -o mcdp.exe https://github.com/zupermind/mcdp-binaries/releases/latest/download/mcdp-[VERSION]-windows-amd64.exe

# For ARM64
curl -L -o mcdp.exe https://github.com/zupermind/mcdp-binaries/releases/latest/download/mcdp-[VERSION]-windows-arm64.exe

# Verify installation
.\mcdp.exe version
```


**üí° Tip:** This is a CLI tool. If you double-click the .exe file, you'll see nothing; you have to use it from a terminal.

</details>

## üîÑ Updating

The MCDP CLI includes a built-in self-update feature:

```bash
mcdp update
```

This command will:
- Check for the latest version
- Download and install it automatically
- Preserve your current settings

**Note for Windows users:** You may need to run PowerShell as Administrator when using the `mcdp update` command if MCDP was installed with the installer to `C:\Program Files\MCDP`.

## üéØ Getting Started

Once installed, you can:

```bash
# View help and available commands
mcdp help

# Check version
mcdp version
```

**Note:** On Windows, the executable is `mcdp.exe`, but you can simply type `mcdp` in your terminal.
